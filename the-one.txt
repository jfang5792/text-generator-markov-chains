I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, don't you think so?
Rose flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
